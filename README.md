> How to learn software design and architecture

Below you'll find a big map for junior, self-taught and intermediate developers to learn more about software design and architecture. 

As a JavaScript turned strictly TypeScript developer, I realized that software design was a huge topic and I felt that I wasn't getting the most out of my object-oriented TypeScript.

I made this chart to mind map my process of learning software design and architecture over the past year; sharing them here so that the community can benefit from it as well.

If you think that these can be improved in anyway, please do suggest.
